## Overview of the Project for my GitHub profile.

# Project: RED TEAM VS. BLUE TEAM SIMULATION:

Set up a simulated cybersecurity exercise where a red team (attackers) attempts to
breach the security of a network defended by a blue team (defenders). Design and execute
attack scenarios while monitoring and responding to security incidents.

# Red and Blue Competition for Cybersecurity Training—Case Study
Through the paradigm of a Red Team and Blue Team cybersecurity simulation, the Red Team assumes the role of an ethical hacker, strategically endeavoring to exploit vulnerabilities that have been identified by the Blue Team. This simulation embodies the concept of penetration testing, a process that involves replicating the techniques and methodologies employed by real-world attackers. This pragmatic approach signifies a departure from relying solely on theoretical capabilities and security equipment, instead anchoring the company’s defense mechanisms in their actual performance when confronted with genuine threats.
The essence of red teaming lies in its capacity to provide an authentic assessment of an organization’s cybersecurity incident response capabilities. By simulating genuine attack scenarios, red teaming serves as a test for an organization’s preparedness to counter sophisticated cyber threats. In direct contrast, the Blue Team undertakes the role of network defenders within this simulation. Their pivotal role involves identifying and rectifying vulnerabilities, effectively learning which aspects within the organizational framework require attention and improvement. Furthermore, their engagement enhances their ability to swiftly respond to and mitigate potential breaches.
While prevention is widely acknowledged as a cornerstone of cybersecurity, this simulation underscores the equal significance of detection and remediation. These three facets together fortify an organization’s overall defense capability. By fusing the proactive measures of the Blue Team with the probing initiatives of the Red Team, this simulation cultivates a holistic approach to cybersecurity that not only safeguards against potential attacks but also bolsters the organization’s capacity to effectively counteract them.

# Core System Structure for Red and Blue Competition
The Red and Blue mission incorporates an infrastructure comprising a core system and a series of network segments, the count of which corresponds to the number of participating teams. This intricate setup is responsible for scrutinizing the services hosted on each team’s virtual machines, validating submitted flags, and allocating points accordingly. Each distinct segment is exclusively designated for a particular team and encompasses a cluster of VMs equipped with diverse vulnerable services, totaling six such segments. The interconnection of these segments is facilitated by a router, which enforces a set of rules governing inter-team permissions. These rules include restrictions such as permitting solely direct access to a team’s own network and implementing network address translation to obscure the actual IPs of both the adversary teams and the core system.
